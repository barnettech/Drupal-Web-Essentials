/**
 * Implements hook_menu().  Hook menu declares a menu item and
 * a page for said menu item.  This is how you
 * will create custom pages.  In the below code (We'll explain more about
 * the PHP involved in a later chapter) you see simple-page is declared as the
 * url to get to this new page.  You see we define the page's title.  You see
 * we defined the page callback which basically means, go further into the
 * code and find the page callback specified (also called a function in PHP *jargon),
 * in this case simple_module_page.  Then it will execute this page *callback code specified.  We then within this callback put some HTML into *the $content variable and return that content back to render on the screen.
